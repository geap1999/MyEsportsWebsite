      <h5>When did I start competing ?</h5> <br> 
      <p>In december of 2018, the new title for the Super Smash Bros video game series, Super Smash bros Ultimate came out. The game regroups the mascots of the biggest Nintendo franchises such as Mario, Pikachu, Kirby duking it out.</p>

<p>Super Smash Bros is a type of game that we call a 2D platform fighter, a subgenre of 2D fighters. Platform fighters emphasizes fighting on stages and you win by sending your opponent offstage (<a href="Smash.html">click here for illustration</a>). 
</p>
<br>


 <p>
   I have been playing the game since the third installment of the series, so since 2008. Until then I haven't participated in any type of competition but with Ultimate I wanted to test my skills at the game. It's been now almost 4 years since I started competing and have now retired.</p>
 
<br><br>
 <h5> What does competing feel like ?</h5>
<br>
  <p>
    Most of the time you might feel stressed and pressured. The stakes are high, especially when you have built a reputation, not to mention the fee you also paid. You want to go far, you want to prove yourself not just to others but to yourself of your worth. This can be very exhausting and make you burn out of the game.</p><br>
   <p> That is why it is important to have fun at the same time, as you will play with less pressure. Another feeling you might commonly get is adrenaline rush especially in tense moments where it can go one way or the other. It's not pleasant but it does makes you feel alive.</p><br>
<p>I think the best feeling I've felt in tournaments was being in the zone. Being in the zone is playing at your highest level, in utmost confidance with each button press and every decision you make, all in fractions of seconds. Being in tune with the game.
  </p>

<br><br>
<h5>What has competing brought me ?</h5>
<br>
<p>
  It's simple. A bundle of emotions that have never made me feel so alive. When I didn't get the results I wanted I was frustrated, angry, disapointed but when I did get them I felt like a king, especially when I beat players that are ranked higher than me and having my friends cheer me on in the background.</p><br>
      <p>It was a very rewarding experience and I feel like I grew as a person. I have made many friends that I still talk to even though I stopped competing. I loved building my reputation little by little, going from being a completely random player to someone somewhat reconized in the community. Seeing other players and friends grow to become good players or even top french players made it seem like we went through a journey together. Now, I would like to find these same thrills but in another type of competition: karate.</p>
